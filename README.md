# Tail Recursion
In this exercise we'll take a simple sequence and we will implement them it first in a head-recursive, then in a tail-recursive manner to look at the difference between the two implementations

## Fibonacci
In a Fibonacci sequence each number is the sum of the previous two numbers, while the series always starts with 0 and 1.
The series starts like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

Ask the user to input the lenght of the sequence that should be calculated (e.g. if the input is 15, calculate the first 15 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence).
Implement this first with a recursive method call, then in a tail recursive manner
